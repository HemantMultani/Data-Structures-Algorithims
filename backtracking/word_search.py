"""
Relationship Between DFS and Backtracking
In your case:

The DFS approach explores adjacent cells in the grid in a deep-first manner (going deep along a path of neighboring cells).
The Backtracking approach is the process of undoing moves (i.e., "backtracking" to a previous state) when a solution path turns out to be incorrect (i.e., the current sequence of characters does not form the word).
Often, DFS with backtracking is used together in these types of problems:

DFS is the search method used to explore each path.
Backtracking ensures that when a path doesnâ€™t work, you undo (or "backtrack") to try other possible paths without repeating any incorrect decisions.
